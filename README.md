FitKeeper
=========

It's really old app, built by me in HighSchool as an internal project in 2010/2011. It's still in a Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.directsolutions.fitkeeper_lite

FITKEEPER allows to:
- track continously speed and calories burned,
- save finished workout,
- view previously saved workouts on the map,
- race with previously saved workout,
- use voice notifications during workout,
- use both imperial and metric system,
- control the amount consumed during the day nutrients,
- put products into your diet by scanning the bar code,
- add your own products and assign them to the bar code,
- define or calculate automatically the demand for nutrients during the day.
Built-in assistant will advise you on what you should eat to your diet as close as possible to the ideal!
